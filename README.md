## Summary

Back in 2014 I was determined to become a programmer. After reading the Head First Javascript book, I wasn't sure what project to work on. I eventually landed on Tetris.

It took me more than a month to work through building out all the functionality that was needed. I learned A TON about problem solving and some of the different concepts I had learned in Javascript (such as working with classes). It was challenging at times but worth every minute. :-)
